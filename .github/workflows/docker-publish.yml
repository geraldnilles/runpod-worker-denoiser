# .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml
# This workflow builds a Docker image and pushes it to the
# GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) when a new tag (e.g., "v1.2.3") is pushed.

name: Build and Push Docker Image to GHCR

# 1. TRIGGER
# This workflow runs on any tag push that starts with 'v' (e.g., "v1.0", "v2.3.1")
on:
  push:
    tags: [ "v*" ]

# 2. PERMISSIONS
# We must grant the workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN permissions to
# read the repo contents and write packages (our container image).

      # 3. Extract metadata (tags and labels) for Docker
      # This is a best-practice step from 'docker/metadata-action'.
      # Since this workflow runs on a Git tag, it will automatically
      # create useful tags for your image based on that tag.
      # For example, pushing Git tag 'v1.2.3' will create image tags:
      #   ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO:1.2.3
      #   ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO:latest
